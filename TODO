 - <error> return value / nextstate
 - built in error / warning state has an additional column with the text
   message
 - Allow warning state AND actual next state   | <warn> :nextstate | The warning message
 - Correctly detect badly formatted row - wrong number of delimiters, etc.
 - Fix unexpected :eof so it doesn't do the weird unicode char
 - Fix "unexpected ..." so it works again
 - Automatically put {eof?} (by itself) clauses at beginning
 - Get per-state eof? detection working again (for final else clause)
 - Errors when state isn't present. Warnings even if it is never referenced
 - highlight `c` specially
 - Allow `b<<` etc. in statements - implied 'c' source


 - mechanism for simple nondeterminism
 - syn highlight
 - parser generator implementation notes / examples
 - bootstrap a real spec parser with a real intermediate language
 - full test suite that languages can essentially inherit from for testing
   their implementations.
