 - Allow   `<<b`   etc. in statements for throwing away values
 - highlight `c` specially
 - Allow `b<<` etc. in statements - implied 'c' source

 - mechanism for simple nondeterminism
 - syn highlight
 - parser generator implementation notes / examples
 - bootstrap a real spec parser with a real intermediate language
 - full test suite that languages can essentially inherit from for testing
   their implementations.
